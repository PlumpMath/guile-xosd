* Changes in 0.2 (since 0.1)

** `xosd-create' argument is optional (defaults to 1)

** "pre-inst-env.el" added

* Initial release 0.1 (changes comparing with 'lisposd')

** C file with guile bindings cleaned up to avoid compilation warnings

SCM_STRINGP, etc.).

** The GNU Build System infrastructure added

The hand-written Makefile was replaced with "configure.ac" and
"Makefile.am" files.

** .scm files added

Instead of defining module in a .c file, the real Guile files were
added: (xosd) and (xosd config) modules.

See commit a02d2040761bbd529219fe5a0e2ff92c465450ab.

** Missing procedures added

`make-xosd' was renamed to `xosd-create'; `xosd-destroy` was added.

** Documentation added

Both texinfo manual and docstrings for the Guile procedures were added.

** Examples added

The resulting package includes "clock.scm" and "volume.scm" files.

** "pre-inst-env" script added
