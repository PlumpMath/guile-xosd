Yann Hodique <Yann.Hodique@lifl.fr> is the original author of "lisposd"
<https://github.com/sigma/lisposd>, i.e., of the C file with Guile
bindings.

Alex Kost <alezost@gmail.com> made some changes in "libguile-xosd.c" and
wrote all the rest (GNU Build System infrastructure, guile modules,
documentation and examples).
