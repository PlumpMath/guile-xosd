;;; Commentary:

;; This is a simple example showing how Guile-XOSD can be used to
;; display sound volume by getting info from 'amixer' output.
;;
;; This script passes all its arguments to 'amixer' and parses its
;; output by searching a line like this:
;;
;;   ... Playback 39118 [60%] [on]
;;
;; or this:
;;
;;   ... Playback 32 [50%] [-32.00dB] [off]
;;
;; Examples of using:
;;
;;   sound.scm sget Master
;;   sound.scm sset Master toggle
;;   sound.scm sset Master 40%
;;
;; See 'man amixer' for more info.  Note: 'amixer' is a program from
;; 'alsa-utils' package (or whatever it is called by your distribution):
;; <http://www.alsa-project.org/>.

;; Actually, this is not a real world example.  It has 2 downsides:
;;
;; 1. At first, well, it's not a compiled C program, it's just a Guile
;; script, so it is not super-fast :-)
;;
;; 2. This script exits only after the sound OSD disappears (the timeout
;; is set to 3 seconds), so, for example, if you bind "sound.scm sset
;; Master 3%+" to some key in your window manager, you'll not be very
;; happy if you quickly press this key several times: the sound will be
;; increased properly (by 3% each time) but you'll see several OSDs
;; laying on each other, as another "sound.scm" script will be called
;; when the previous one(s) is(are) still alive.
;;
;; In practice I use the following solution, that allows me to overcome
;; both downsides: I start Guile-Daemon with the config that sets all
;; this "sound OSD" stuff, and then I just send small Guile expressions
;; to the Daemon for evaluating.  As you can see, I'm still using Guile
;; to set the sound and to display OSD, but it is *very fast* and it's
;; the same OSD object every time!
